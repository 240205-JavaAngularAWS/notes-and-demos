# Services and Dependency Injection

Services are used to organize and share business logic, models, data or functions with different components of an Angular Application

Each service is a singleton instance that can be injected into multiple components. Essentially creating reusable code

In Angular a service is a class that is used to share data across multiple components, and they live in a file with .services.ts extension

We use Dependency Injection to inject services into components of our application

Dependency Injection allows a class to receive its dependencies from an outside source, instead of creating them itself

-   This helps decouple our code

The framework uses an Injector where we register all the dependencies to me managed, it is repsonisble for creating service instances and injecting them into components

The Injector holds all the services, registers them with the NgModule or if otherwise specified with their provider

-   The provider tells where it the application to register the service
-   The registered services can be accessed via Depenency Injection token, which is a lookup key

## Creating/Using a service

To create a service use `ng g s name` this will create a name.service.ts file with the @Injectable decorator on the class

@Injectable marks a class as a service that can be injected

-   The proviedIn property allows you to set the service class, it also declares where it can be used
-   The Injector provides the single instance of our service
-   A hierarchy of injectors at the NgModule and component level can provide different instances of a service to their own compoents and child components

# Pipes

Pipes provide a way to transform values in an Angular template, you can use the pipe symbol ( | ) and they can take almost any datatype and transform it

There are many built-in pipes in Angular:

-   Date pipe: used to formatting dates
-   Decimal pipe: used to formatting numbers
-   Currency pipe: used for formatting currencies
-   Percent pipe: used to formatting percent values
-   Slice pipe: used for slicing string
-   Lowecase pipe: used to convert strings to lowercase
-   Uppercase pipe: used to convert strings to uppercase
-   Titlecase: use to convert string to titlecase
-   Json pipe: used for converting values into a json format
-   Async pipe: used for unwrapping values from an asynchronous primitive

# Custom Pipes

Not only are their built-in pipes, you can also create your own

To create a custom pipe, use the CLI command `ng g pipe pipe-name`

This will create two files, a name.pipe.ts file, and a name.pipe.spec.ts file, to implement your pipe include your logic in the name.pipe.ts file

The name.pipe.ts file will have a class that implements PipeTransform, and you must implement the method transform from this interface

# Setting up Routing

Routing is how we navigate between pages in a single page application

Angular provides routing with the RouterModule, it has all the neccessary service providers and directives for navigating through the applications views

The router defines navigation of views on a SPA, and interprets URL links to determine which component/view to load or unload

A routing component imports the Router module, and its template contains a RouterOutlet element where it can display views produced by the router

# Route Guards

Router guards are used to check whether the user whould be granted or remove acess to certain parts of navigation

There are 4 different interfaces that act as routing guards:

-   CanActivate: decides if the route can be activated
-   CanActivateChild: decides if children of the route can be activated
-   CanLoad: decides if the route can be loaded
-   CanDeactivate: decides if the user can leave the route

To create a route guard, use the `ng g guard name` command, and use it by imposing one of the 4 interfaces above in the route module
