# Transactions
In SQL, a transaction is a sequence of one or more SQL operations that are treated as a single unit of work. Transactions are used to ensure data integrity and consistency in a database system, particularly in multi-user environments where multiple transactions may be executed concurrently.

## TCL

-   Used to manage transactions within the database (more on this later)
-   Syntax/Keywords for TCL:
    -   `COMMIT`: this will permanently save any DML operations that occurred
    -   `ROLLBACK`: this will completely erase any DML operations that occurred between two commits. Keep in mind, once you commit changes you cannot rollback
    -   `SAVEPOINT`: creates a spot to rollback to


## Acid Properties

In SQL every transaction must have a specific four properties, these are know as the ACID properties

**Atomic:** All or nothing, the transaction is fully completed, or it doesn't happen at all

**Consistency:** The tables schema will remain intact after the transaction

**Isolation:** Each transaction cannot affect the results of another transaction

**Durability:** Data will persist through system crashes and other issues

# Constraints

Constraints are restrictions that we can put on the columns of our tables in SQL

Some constraints in SQL include:

-   Composite keys: a key that uses more than one column
-   Not null: the column must have data
-   Unique: no two records entered into this column can be the same
-   Primary key: denotes that this column is a primary key
-   Foreign key: denotes that this column is pointing to an attribute on another table
-   Default: creates a default value if none is given

# Indexes

An index is a common way to enhance database performance, enabling faster retrieval. When creating an index, the database stores an in memory ordering of a particular column. Without an index, if we were searching on a particular column, we would need to check every single value in that column to return the result. Indexes allow those operations to be more efficient. Columns which are searched on frequently, and that have a high percent of unique values and a low percent of null values are generally good candidates for an index. While indexes can make searching operations more efficient, we need to be careful not to use indexes too liberally. Because we are storing an additional ordering in memory, they need to be maintained every time we perform operations like insertions and deletions, so they may not always be the best choice.

# SQL Server

SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. It provides a robust platform for storing and managing structured data. SQL Server offers various features including:

- **Relational Database Engine**: Core component for storing, processing, and securing data.
- **Integration Services (SSIS)**: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tool for data integration and workflow applications.
- **Analysis Services (SSAS)**: Analytical processing and data mining capabilities.
- **Reporting Services (SSRS)**: Reporting platform for creating, managing, and delivering interactive reports.
- **Machine Learning Services (In-Database)**: Integration of Python and R for data analysis within the database engine.

## Selection of Edition

SQL Server offers different editions tailored to meet the needs of various users and workloads. Common editions include:

- **Enterprise Edition**: Comprehensive features for mission-critical applications and large-scale data warehouses.
- **Standard Edition**: Core database functionality for smaller-scale applications and departmental deployments.
- **Developer Edition**: Fully-featured edition for development and testing purposes.
- **Express Edition**: Free edition with limited features, suitable for small databases and lightweight applications.

Select the edition based on factors such as budget, feature requirements, and scalability needs.

## Authentication Mode

SQL Server supports two authentication modes:

- **Windows Authentication Mode**: Uses Windows accounts for authentication, providing integrated security and centralized management through Active Directory.
- **Mixed Mode (Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication)**: Allows authentication using Windows accounts or SQL Server accounts, providing flexibility for environments without Active Directory or for applications requiring SQL Server logins.

Choose the authentication mode based on security requirements and existing infrastructure.

## SQL Server Configuration Manager

SQL Server Configuration Manager is a tool for managing SQL Server services and network connectivity. Key features include:

- **Service Management**: Start, stop, pause, and configure SQL Server services.
- **Network Configuration**: Configure network protocols and connection settings.
- **SQL Server Configuration**: Set server-specific configuration options such as memory allocation, maximum degree of parallelism, and error logging.
- **Viewing Log Files**: Access and analyze SQL Server log files for troubleshooting and monitoring.

Use SQL Server Configuration Manager to manage and configure various aspects of SQL Server deployment.


# T-SQL Overview

Transact-SQL (T-SQL) is a procedural extension of SQL (Structured Query Language) developed by Microsoft. It is primarily used with Microsoft SQL Server databases but is also supported by other database systems. T-SQL provides additional features beyond the standard SQL, allowing for more advanced data manipulation and procedural capabilities.

## Advantages of T-SQL:

1. **Procedural Capabilities**: T-SQL allows for the creation of stored procedures, functions, and triggers, enabling developers to encapsulate business logic within the database itself.

2. **Enhanced Functionality**: T-SQL includes various functions and operators that extend the capabilities of standard SQL, such as string manipulation functions, mathematical functions, and date/time functions.

3. **Exception Handling**: T-SQL supports try-catch blocks for exception handling, providing better error management and control over the execution flow.

4. **Transaction Control**: T-SQL provides commands for transaction control, including BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT TRANSACTION, and ROLLBACK TRANSACTION, allowing developers to manage data consistency and integrity.

5. **Rich Data Types**: T-SQL supports a wide range of data types, including user-defined types, XML, JSON, and spatial data types, offering flexibility in data storage and manipulation.
