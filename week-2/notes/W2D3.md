# DOM

## Document Object Model (DOM):

Tree like structure representing the HTML document known as the DOM tree

-   Allows javascript to access and manipulate elements and styles on a webpage

The root of the DOM tree is our HTML tag, otherwise known as the document object

-   Every other element is a node that can be accessed via Javascript

To gain acess to the DOM you simple use the `document` object in Javascript, it gives you access to methods to select elements, traverse and manipulate the HTML Page

# Selecting Elements and Traversing the DOM

There are several ways to select an element in the DOM tree:

-   `document.getElementById("idname")`: select a single element based off of its id attribute
-   `document.getElementsByClassName("classname")`: select a group of elements with the same class attribute
-   `document.getElementsByTagName("tag")`: select all elements with that specified tag
-   `document.querySelector("selector")` and `document.querySelectorAll("selector")`: select an element/s with a specified CSS selector

The document object provides us ways to move through the tree with different properties gaining access to pretty much any object in the tree

To gain access to the top most nodes you can use:

-   `document.documentElement` to access the html element
-   `document.head` to access head tag
-   `document.body` to access body tag

To gain access to the parent nodes of the currently selected element

-   `element.parentNode`
-   `element.parentElement`

To gain access to children nodes of an element:

-   `element.childNodes`
-   `element.firstChild`
-   `element.lastChild`

To gain access to sibling nodes of an element:

-   `element.previousElementSibling`
-   `element.nextElementSibling`

# DOM Manipulation

On top of access, and traversing through the tree, you are also able to change/manipulate elements in the dom three with JS

-   `document.createElement()` you can create an element and insert into the dom tree
-   `element.replaceChild()` remove an element from the DOM and replace it with another
-   `element.removeChild()` to completely remove and element
-   `element.insertBefore()` to insert an element before the selected one
-   `element.innerText` and `element.textContent` to change, set, or get the text in an element
-   `element.innerHTML` to set the HTML of an element
-   `element.cloneNode()` used to clone an element

There are also many other useful methods and properties that you can leverage on the element objects to manipulate the page in JS

You can use these methods to manage attributes of html elements:

-   `element.getAttribute("attname")`
-   `element.setAttribute("attname")`
-   `element.removeAttribute("attname")`
-   `element.hasAttribute("attname")`

# Events and Listeners

Events occur when a user interacts with a webpage, or when the browser triggers one

You can configure your webpage to handle these events with Javascript using event handlers, events you can handle include:

-   onclick: this is a click event occurs when a user clicks the element on the webpage

-   ondblclick: this is a click event occurs when a user double clicks on element on the webpage

-   onload: this is a load event occurs when the browser is finished loading the page

-   onunload: this is a load event occurs when a user closed the document

-   onresize: this is a load event occurs when the browser window is minimized or maximized

-   onmouseover: this is a mouse event occurs when a user mouses over an element

-   onmouseout: this is a mouse even occurs when a user moves the mouse off of an element

-   onkeydown, onkeyup, are keyboard events occur when a user presses or releases a key

-   onfocus: this a form input event occurs when the user gives focus to an element on the webpage

-   onblur is the opposite of on focus

-   onchange: this is a form event that occurs when a user changes the input in a form

-   onsubmit: this is a form event that occurs when a user submits a form

There are three ways you can register an event handler:

1. Inline, where you set the on... attribute of the html element to a predefined function in your js code
2. You can set the event property of the html element to a predefined JS function
3. You can use the `element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture)`

# The Event Object

In Javascript events are represented by an Event Object

Event Objects have the following properties and methods:

-   bubbles: a boolean value which indicates the propagation method, it is true by default
-   currentTarget: a reference to the DOM element whose event listener triggered the specific event
    -   This is different from the event that initally triggered the event as a single event can trigger multple event listeners through propagation
-   preventDefault(): cancel the event/prevents the default action of the event
-   stopPropagation(): prevents the event from propagating further
-   target: a reference to the DOM element that triggered the event
-   timeStamp: the time of the event in miliseconds
-   type: the type of the event

## Types of Events

There are several subclasses of the Event Object, which all include their own properties as well as the properties of the event object

-   A complete list of event objects can be found here: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_events.asp

## MouseEvent

This is an event that is generated when the user interacts with elements on the page with a mouse

Events like click, onmouseenter, onmouseleave, and so create mouse event objects

The MouseEvent object has many properties that hold information about the state of the machine when the event occured:

-   Coordinates of the mouse relative to the window: clientX and clientY
-   Coordinates of the mouse relative to the last event: movementX, movementY
-   Coordniates of the mouse relative to the target: offsetX, offsetY
-   Coordinates of the mouse relative to the screen: screenX, screenY
-   Whether alt, ctrl, or shift were held when clicking: altKey, ctrlKey, and shiftKey
-   Which mouse button was hit: button, buttons, which

## KeyboardEvent

This is an event that is generated when the user interacts with elements on the page with their keyboard

You would typically use this to add funcionality to webforms

Events onkeydown, onkeypress, and onkeyup create KeyboardEvent objects

This object has the following properties:

-   Whether alt, ctrl, or shift were hit during the event: altKey, ctrlKey, shiftKey
-   Which key was hit: key, keycode, and which
-   Whether the key is being held down: repeat

# Bubbling/Capturing

Javascript has something called event propagation, which essentially how the event flows through the components on the page

There are two ways in which an event can propagate, the first is called bubbling, the second is called capturing

## Event Bubbling

Bubbling is the default event propagating for event listeners

-   Follow a bottom up approach
-   The event starts at the target element, then "bubbles" its way up the tree

Essentially when an event happens, it first goes to any handlers on that element, then that elements parents, then grandparents, and so on until it reaches the top of the html document

Bubbling works for all handlers, regardless of how they are registered

## Event Capturing

Event capturing is the opposite of bubbling, instead of going from the target element to the top of the tree, it will start at the top and work its way down to the target element

-   Following a top down approach

Capturing only works with event handlers that are registered with .addEventListener() with an added third argument that is set to true

# Intro to Asynchronous Javascript

program does not need to wait for a specific task that takes a long time

It simply start executing the function, then moves on to the next function while it finishes

-   You can send a request/start a lengthy function, and forget about it
-   Then when you receive the reponse/the function is finished you can handle it
-   You program does not need to wait for the response in the mean time

This is useful with API calls, and other processes that could hold up or "block" the execution of your programs main thread

## How Asynchronous Javascript Works

Javascript implements a stack where functions calls are stored

-   It uses a single thread to add, and call functions on the stack one at a time, until the stack is empty
-   This is how basic synchronous programming works

Javascript also has a built in queue, and the browser/node runtime environment has extra threads that can used by Javascript, the queue is used by the event loop

## Javascript Event Loop

When an asynchronous call happens, Javascript allows the browser thread/web api to handle the specific call, while moving on in the stack

Once the web api is done processing the function, it will return the callback or the response to the queue, then the next time the call stack is empty, the event loop will return response/callback from the queue

## Basic Animation of the event loop

```javascript
const foo = () => console.log("First");
const bar = () => setTimeout(() => console.log("Second"), 500);
const baz = () => console.log("Third");

bar();
foo();
baz();
```

## Basic Steps of the Event Loop in JS

1. Asynchronous call gets added to the stack
2. JS decides to hand it off to the web api where it processes
3. Other functions can be added and executed on the call stack while the web api works
4. Once the web api has a response it gets added to the queue
5. The event loop checks the queue when the call stack is empty to see if something needs to be added to the call stack
6. Our response/callback is added to call stack and process as normal

# Promises

Javascript uses promises for async opperations, they are placeholders for a future value. Many async functions return implicitly

Promises in Javascript are objects, and you create them using the new keyword

Promises take a callback function called the executor, this automatically runs the when the object is created

-   The executor also takes two callbacks, resolve and reject
    -   `resolve(value)` return the result of the job once it finishes sucessfully
    -   `reject(error)` is called when there is an error with processing the job

Promises have a property called status which gives us information about the state of the object. The promise can be in one of three states

-   pending
-   fulfilled
-   rejected

The promise objects connects the executor and any consuming functions which will receieve the result or the error from the promise

You would use `.then()` `.catch()` and `.finally()` methods on the promise object to consume (chain) the results or errors of the promise object

# Fetch API

fetch is a more modern and versatile way of making AJAX requests
The fetch API is provided by the window object, and provides the `.fetch()` method

-   `.fetch()` is used to send requests and returns a promise that is retrieved from the response
-   Successful requests get resolved, the returned promise will have the response body
-   Request that return an error HTTP-Status will be rejected

There are various methods you can use to access the response body of a success request:

-   `response.text()` read the response and return as text
-   `response.json()` parse the response as JSON
-   `response.formData()` return the response as FormData object
-   `response.blob()` return the response as Blov (binary data with type)
-   `response.arrayBuffer()` return the response as an ArrayBuffer (low level representation of binary data)

# async/await

introduced in ES8 to simplify asynchronous functionality

The async keyword denotes that a function will operate asynchronously via the event loop

-   Any function with the async keyword will implicitly return a promise object
-   Yuo can use any of the consumer function on the return of an async function, however there are nicer ways to handle these promises using await

The await keyword only works inside of async functions

-   await tells Javascript to wait for a promise to resolved before moving on
-   You can use await when calling any function that returns a promise, but it must be inside of an async function
-   It allows you to gather data, or wait for something while also not blocking the main thread

You no longer need to chain consumer functions together, making your code easier to read
