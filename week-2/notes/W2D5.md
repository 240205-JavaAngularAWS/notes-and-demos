# Single Page Applications

Single Page Applications or (SPA's) are webapps that render on a single page in the browser

Aall of our Javascript, HTML, and CSS are loaded in and ready for the browser in one page load

During navigation, the browser never refreshes because you stay on the same page

We will use Angular to create our SPA's

The advantages of SPA's

-   Fast and responsive
-   Caching capability
-   Pleasant user experience across multiple platforms

Disadvantages

-   Don't perform well with SEO
-   Less secure against Cross-site scripting
-   The page may take longer to load initially


# History of Angular

Angular is a Typescript based, open source framework used to develope dynamic web applications

Angular has gone through many changes since it was created by Google in 2010

-   It started out as AngularJS
-   In 2016 a completely rewritten version was released
    -   This prompted the name change from AngularJS to Angular2
-   Angular is now commonly known as Angular 2+
-   Angular 4 is now the standard, that is what we will use
-   After Angular 4, there has been small incremental changes, about every 6 months

## AngularJS vs Angular 4+

AngularJS is a javascript-based open source web framework, that doesn't support the features of a server-side programming language, nor dynamic page loading

Angular 4+ is a complete rewrite of Angular JS, with a complete comparison below:

| Angular JS                                                                                         | Angular 4+                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Uses MVC architecture to build the applications.                                                   | Uses component based UI to build the applications.                                                                               |
| AngularJS is written in JavaScript.                                                                | Angular is compatible with the most recent versions of TypeScript that have powerful type checking and object-oriented features. |
| To bind an image/property or an event with AngularJS, you have to remember the right ng directive. | Angular focuses on “( )” for event binding and “[ ]” for property binding.                                                       |
| AngularJS doesn't support mobiles.                                                                 | Angular support mobiles.                                                                                                         |

Angular uses Typescript, and uses several main building block we will discuss this week:

-   modules
-   components
-   templates
-   metadata
-   data binding
-   directives
-   services
-   dependency injection

# Angular CLI

The Angular CLI is a command-line interface for Angular, that helps us get started with creating an Angular application

-   It sets up the project in Typescript, and installs dependencies like Webpack, Karma for testing, and others

To install the Angular CLI use `npm install -g @angular/cli`

To create a new Angular project use `ng new app-name`

To start your application use `ng serve --open`

## Angular File Structure

-   e2e holds files for end-to-end tests, and test specific config files
-   node_modules holds all of our dependencies
-   src folder holds the source code for our application


# Angular Modules

In angular a module is a group of components that are related, and can be combined with other modules to create an entire application

There are two types of modules, root modules and feature modules

In our Angular applications we have a single root module, which is where our application is bootstrapped, and the application can have zero or more feature modules, which can be groups of related components

To create a feature module, you can run the cli command `ng generate module modulename --module app.module`

## @NgModule Decorator

We use the @NgModule decorator to mark a class as an angular module

In the AppModule we use @NgModule to setup the root of the appliction, but if you wanted, you could create other modules and include them in the main application module

NgModule takes metadata and describes how to compile a compents templates how to create an injector at runtime

The Angular CLI creates the AppModule where we use the NgModule for us, it takes the following metadata:

-   declarations: a list of components, directives, and pipes which belong to the app
-   imports: alist of modules, which are used by the component templates
-   providers: a list of service providers the application needs
-   boostrap: contains the root component of the application

The steps to starting an Angular application (bootstrapping):

1. the main.ts in an entry poin of an angular application
2. We bootstrap an angular application and pass app.module.ts as an argument. In app.module.s we tell angular to bootstrap the AppComponent
3. Angular analyzes this AppComponent and knows there is an app-root selector defined
4. Angular handles app-root in the index.html file
5. index.html gets loaded on the browser

# Components and @Component Decorator

Components are the basic building blocks of our application

The purpose of components is so we can break up our UI and logic into individual pieces, each component has a specific purpose

An Angular application has one root component (AppComponent) which is specified in the bootstrap array under the main ngModule

We declare a component with the @Component Decorator

The @Component decorator needs to be imported from the @angular/core module, and will be used in the ts file of your component

Components can also have associated HTML, and CSS files to describe how the component should look

Inside of our @Component decorator there are a few properties:

-   selector: a css selector that tells angular to crate and insert an instance of this component into a specified element
-   templateUrl: the module relative address to the components THL template, or an inline HTML template
-   styleUrls: an array of css files or inline css styles

You can use inline templates in the Angular HTML template using double curly braces {{}} to bind data from our components

You declare these properties inside of the export of the compoent class

The easiest way to create a component is `ng generate component c-name` this will generate all the relevant files for a component

# Component Lifecycle Methods

The life cycle of a Angular component is:

-   Creation
-   Render
-   Create/Render Children
-   Check for data changes
-   Destroy before remove it from DOM

These events are called LifeCycle hooks, and these have 8 different function calls that correspond to the lifecycle event

<img src = "https://geeksarray.com/images/blog/angular-component-lifecycle.png" height = "600">

**constructor** - The constructor of the component class gets executed first, before the execution of any other lifecycle hook. If we need to inject any dependencies into the compoent, then the constructor is the best place to do it

**ngOnChanges** - Called whenever the input properties of the component change. It returns _SimpleChanges_ object which holds any current and previous property values

**ngOnInit** - Called once to intialize the component and set the input properties. It initializes the component after Angular first displays the data-bound properties

**ngDoCheck** - Called during all change-detection tuns that Angular cant detect on its own. Also called immediately after the ngOnChanges method

**ngAfterContentInit** - Invoked once after Angular performs any content projection into the components view

**ngAfterContentChecked** - Invoked after each time Angular checks for content projected into the component, it is called after ngAfterContentInit, and every subsequent ngDoCheck

**ngAfterViewInit** - Invoked adter Angular initalizes the compoents view and its child views

**ngAfterViewChecked** - Invoked after each time Angular checks for content prjected into the component. It is called after ngAfterViewInit and every subsequent ngAfterContentChecked

**ngOnDestroy** - Invoked before Angular destroys the directive of component

# Take a look at lifecycle methods

# Data Binding

In Angular, Data binding provides the communication between a component and the DOM

Angular supports 1 way and 2 way data binding

## 1-way data binding

1-way data binding allows us to manipulate views through models, and its achieved through:

-   String interpolation: binding data from a typescript class to the template using the double curly braces {{}}

-   Property binding: allows us to bind values to the attributes of HTML elements. Uses []

-   Event binding: allows us to bind DOM events such as keystrokes, button clicks, etc to a function in the component. Uses ()

## 2-way data binding

In 1-way data binding changes in the template are not reflected in the component, to solve this we use 2-way data binding

This is achieved by combining property binding and event binding. Uses [(ngModel)]

This is useful for gathering user input

# Event Emitters

EventEmitters are used to emit custom events, synchronously or asynchronously, and register handlers for those events by subscribing to an instance

You use the @Input and @Output decorators to flow data between components

-   If we have to flow data into a component you use @Input
-   If we have to emit the event or data from a component we use @Output


# Structural Directives

Directives are markers on a DOM element that tells Angular to change the appearance, behavior, and/or layout of the DOM element and its children

Structural directives are used to manipulate and change the structure of DOM elements

There are three built-in structural directives:

ngIf: allows us to add or remove DOM elements based upon a Boolean expression

-   you can also add an #elseBlock

ngFor: allows us to repeat a part of the HTML template once per each item from an iterable list

ngSwith: allows us to switch betwen different elements depending on the expression. It is used with the following directives

-   ngSwitchCase
-   ngSwitchDefault

`<ng-template>` is designed to hold some template code

# Attribute Directives

Attribute Directives are used to change the look and behavior of the DOM element

There are two built in attribute directives:

ngClass: used for adding or removing CSS classes on an HTML element. It can allow us to apply CSS classes dynamically based on expression evaulation

ngStyle: allows you to dynamically change the style of an HTML element based on an expression

You can also create your own custom directives using the Angular CLI command `ng generate directive name`

-   This will create a name.directive.ts file, and automatically declares it in the AppModule file


# Webpack

Webpack is a powerful static module bundler for Javascript applications that packages all modules in our application into a bundle and serves it to the browser

This means that all of our JS files and dependencies would be in a single file, all our HTML files would be in a single file, and so

This helps speed up the loading of our webpage, because instead of loading up several files, it just loads one

Webpack builds a dependency graph when it proccesses the application. It starts from a list of modules defined in its config file and recursively builds the dependency graph that includes every module of our application needs, then packages all of those modules into a small bundle that can be loaded by the browser
