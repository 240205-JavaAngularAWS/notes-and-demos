<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- The DOCTYPE tag here is the first tag that should appear whenever you start an html page, basically lets the browser know what version of HTML to use
    The default, current one is HTML 5 -->

<html>
    <!-- The HTML tag is the ROOT tag for all elements on the page (if you think of the other elements like tree branches this is the foundation or root they all trace back too) -->

    <head>
        <!-- Contains Metadata about the webpage to be rendered. The information shown here doesn't normally appear on the page itself
            - <style> used for internall CSS
            - <link> used for making use of an external resource (this will most likely be an externall CSS sheet)
            - <script> contain JavaScript code to provide functionality to this page specifically
            - <meta> include metadata about the page, mainly used for SEO (Search engine optimization) purposes

    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- The body tage contains everything we want to appear of the page itself, it's the "body" of the webpage if you will
        
        There are a lot of different tags we can use here
        <h#> for headings
        <p> for paragraph or general text
        <input> for input fields (think like a form you need to fill out)
        <b> for bolding or <i> for italics

        <ol>, <ul>, <li> for ordered and unordered lists

            <h1>This is My Webpage!</h1>
            <!-- h tags are used for headers, they're sized from h1 to h6 getting progressively smaller -->
            <h3>This is a subtitle!</h3>

            <!-- Paragraph tags are useful for general text that needs to be rendered on the page itself -->

                Let's see if HTML cares about whitespace
            </p>
            <!-- Important to note that HTML doesn't generally care about whitespace in your page's element, if you want to manually add space, use a <br> -->

            <br>

            <p>This is my next paragraph!</p>
